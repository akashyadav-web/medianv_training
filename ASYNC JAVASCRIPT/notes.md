# Day 04 – Async JavaScript

## Topics Covered
- Callbacks
- Promises
- async/await
- Error handling

## Why Async JavaScript?
API calls and database operations take time.
Async JS allows non-blocking execution.

## Callback
A function passed into another function to be executed later.

## Promise
Represents a future value (resolved or rejected).

## async/await
Cleaner way to work with promises.

## Error Handling
Use .catch() or try/catch to handle failures.

## Real Use Case
Fetching data from APIs and databases.
